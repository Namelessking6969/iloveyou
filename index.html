<p style="color:white;"><b>Beautiful, intelligent and all around awesome..Without her i dont know what i would do</b></p>
<p style="color:White;"><b>The first day i met her i never wanted anything else more in my life then to be with her</b></p>
<p style="color:white;"><b>When i reconnected with her, everything was perfect, the way she acted towards me, the way that she made me smile, Everything..</b></p>
<p style="color:white;"><b>When my days are bad, when my life feels like i'm not making it correct, i look at her and come home to her and everything becomes better</b></p>
<p style="color:white;"><b>She is the most amazing and most beautiful person in the world, without her life wouldnt be right, life wouldn't be good..</b></p>
<p style="color:white;"><b>My life was complete when she became apart of it, i had a void in my heart, a hole that i could never fill, Then she came into my life and everything became perfect, Day by day..Hour by hour..Minute by Minute...Second by second, i fall in love with her more and more <3</b></p>
<p style="color:white;"><b>She is my everything, She means everything to me, She is my rock when i am down and my light when i need to see the correct path</b></p>
<p style="color:white;"><b>She makes me feel like im the only one in the world, Makes me feel like life is worth living</b>
<p style="color:white;"><b>She is everything i have ever wanted, she is the reason i wake up everymorning, she is the reason i strive todo better, she is the reason life is worth living..</b>
